# Parsing (Working with) Dates

Sometimes we need `R` to realize some variable is a date. This is where these functions are very valuable.

```{r}
dates_but_not_dates = c("2017-12-13", "2017-12-14", "2017-12-15") 
## what class is it?

now_a_date = ymd(dates_but_not_dates)
now_a_date
class(now_a_date)
str(now_a_date)
```


---
# Parsing (Working with) Dates

Lubridate is very flexible with formatting.

```{r}
dates_but_not_dates = c("2017/12/3", "2017/12/14", "2017/12/15") ## what class is it?
now_a_date = ymd(dates_but_not_dates)
now_a_date
```

```{r}
dates_but_not_dates = c("12031988", "12042010", "01032010")
now_a_date = mdy(dates_but_not_dates)
now_a_date
```

```{r}
dates_but_not_dates = c(12032010, 12102010, 12202010) 
now_a_date = mdy(dates_but_not_dates)
now_a_date
```


---
# Time Distance

Lubridate makes this very natural.

```{r}
first = ymd("2010-12-03")
last = today()
last - first

first = ymd_hms("2010-12-03 13:10:56 MST")
last = now()
last - first
```

# Washing Yo' Data

Sometimes we need to change NAs to some other value, we need to remove NaNs, or replace place-holder values (999s) with NAs.

.pull-left[
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
df = data.frame(
  X = c(0, NA, 1, NA, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0),
  Y = c(rnorm(9), NaN),
  Z = c(999, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1)
)
df
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(furniture)

df %>%
  mutate(X = washer(X, is.na, value = 0),
         Y = washer(Y, is.nan, value = NA),
         Z = washer(Z, 999))
```

# Looping

### Why do we use loops?

1. Want to repeat something over every column of a data frame
2. Need something done repeatedly

--

### What are our options?

1. `apply()` family of functions
2. `for` loops
3. manual

---
# Loops

### `lapply()`

- it repeats something over every column of the data frame
- it can take built in functions and user functions

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
df = data.frame(
  x = c(rnorm(99), NaN),
  y = c(rnorm(99), NaN)
)
tail(df)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
df2 = lapply(df, washer, is.nan) %>%
  data.frame


tail(df2)
```

#### Checking Assumptions

Each package is going to be slightly different but the good ones should have some information about checking assumptions.

#### Basic Principles

1. Visualizations/tables are better than tests
2. Check data and model
3. Each method will have different assumptions and, thus, different techniques to assess them
4. Often, there is a lot of gray area here

#### Normality, Variance (Homoskedasticity), and Leverage

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

```{r, eval=FALSE}

modificationindices(fit)
semTools::reliability(fit)
semTools::measurementInvariance(fit)
