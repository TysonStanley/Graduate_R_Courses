### These don't need to be done in any specific order -- it is an iterative process
### Orange are necessary
### Blue are optional

# What is an R Package?

.large[
Great question!

It is a collection of:

1. Functions
2. Documentation
3. (Optional) Data
4. (Optional) Tests
]

--
.large[
We will discuss the first two in this class, but first:

.coral[Why create a package?]
]

---
# Why, oh, why?

.large[
1. Easily load your favorite functions without having to copy-and-paste it into every file

2. Share it with other researchers easily

3. Provide your data and code easily accessible (for transparent publication)

4. Others surely exist

# Alright, it's pretty cool... How do I make one?

# 1. Functions

.large[
This is just like the ones we created before]

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_function <- function(x){
  ## Stuff for the function to do
  need <- to(decide, what, to, do)
  return(need)
}
```

.large[.coral[
This is the hard part of creating a package -- making the function that does what you need
]]

---
# Example Function

```{r}
michael <- function(string){
  ## takes string and splits it
  splitted <- strsplit(string, " ")[[1]]
  
  ## jumbles it
  jumbled <- splitted[sample(seq_along(splitted), length(splitted))]
  jumbled
}

michael('This is a sentence that made sense')
```

### Not exactly useful, but it is a function that we can put in a package!

---
# Now that you have some functions you like...

.large[.coral[Let's create an R package!]]


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
setwd("Where/you/want/the/package/to_be/located/")

create()               ## creates the package stucture (folders)
create_description()   ## creates the description file
```

.large[
New folders show up and you can start saving files in the right locations

# Package Structure

Ones to know: 
.large[
1. `R` = function files
2. `data` = data
3. `man` = documentation
4. `tests` = tests
5. `vignettes` = vignettes
6. `DESCRIPTION`
7. `NAMESPACE`
8. `README`

# DESCPIPTION File

    Package: furniture
    Type: Package
    Title: Furniture for Quantitative Scientists
    Version: 1.7.0
    Date: 2017-09-16
    Authors@R: c(person("Tyson S.", "Barrett",  
                        role=c("aut","cre"), 
                        email = "t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu",

    Author: Tyson Barrett [aut, cre],
        Emily Brignone [aut],
        Daniel Laxman [aut]
    Maintainer: Tyson Barrett <t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu>
    Description: Contains three main functions (i.e., three pieces of furniture):
        table1() which produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table 1
        in research articles, tableC() which produces a well-formatted table of correlations,
        and washer() which is helpful in cleaning up the data. In addition,
        long() and wide(), built on the stats::reshape(), can help reformat the data.
        These furniture functions are designed to simplify common tasks in 
        quantitative analysis. Other data summary and cleaning tools are also available.

# NAMESPACE

Automatically created for you with `devtools`

.large[
Tells `R` what functions go with that package

# Documentation (Thanks to `devtools`)

.large[
Before each .coral[exported function], you can provide documentation like so:
]

    #' Title
    #'
    #' Description of the function (e.g., what does it do? and who for?)
    #'
    #' @param argument1 what the argument is
    #' @param argument2 what this argument is
    #' 
    #' @examples
    #' 
    #' 
    #' @return whatever the function returns (e.g., a vector)
    #'
    #' @import packages_your_package_relies_on
    #'
    #' @export

---
# Create the Actual documentation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)

setwd("Where/the/package/is/located/")
document()
```

.large[
The `document()` function reads the text you put above your functions and creates all the latex documentation for you
]

---
# Share it on GitHub (Optional)

.large[
Make the package folder a repository, commit it, and sync it
]

<br>
.center[.coral[.large[.large[Example]]]]

<br>
.large[
You can also make changes directly on GitHub
]

---
# Install and Load it

## If you put it on GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("your_username/package_name")
```

## If it is just on your computer:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::load_all("Where/the/package/is/located/")
```
