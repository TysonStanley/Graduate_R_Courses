# Graduate R Courses

Slides and materials used in my intro/intermediate intro R courses. I began using `xaringan` from Yuhui that is based on the `remark.js` presentation tool. I also have created a fake data set regarding The Office (U.S.) and Parks and Rec television shows for examples and tutorials.

I also pull heavily from several other repositories and websites:

1. [John Muschelli's](http://johnmuschelli.com/neuroc/getting_ready_for_submission/index.html) walkthrough of creating a package. It goes into detail using `devtools` and Git.
2. [The Tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org/) which provides walkthroughs, examples, and tutorials using their modern tool set.
3. [Andrew Heiss's](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/08/10/exploring-minards-1812-plot-with-ggplot2/) walkthrough of `ggplot2`.

I'll continually update this site as I develop more material or find beneficial blogs/sites.
