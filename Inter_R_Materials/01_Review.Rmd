# Review of Basic R Objects 
# and Tidyverse

---
# Let's Get Started

### Objects!!

- What are R objects? 

--

- Why are they important?

--

- Can you name some object types?

--
    - vectors
    - data frames
    - lists
    - functions
    - operators
--

- How do you create an object (e.g., a vector)?

--
    - The assignment operator ( `<-` or `=` ) and the `c()` function 😃
      
```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(lots, of, cool, stuff)
```

---
# R Objects

### Vectors
What type of vector does each produce?
```{r}
## Vectors
x = c(9,4,5,2,6)
y = c("male", "female", "female", "male", "female")
z = factor(y)
```

--

1. `x`: `r class(x)`

--

1. `y`: `r class(y)`

--

1. `z`: `r class(z)`

---
# R Objects

### Data Frames and Lists
What is a `data.frame`? What about a `list`?

--

.pull-left[
```{r}
df = data.frame(
  x = c(9,4,5,2,6),
  y = c("male", "female", 
        "female", "male", 
        "female"),
  z = factor(y)
)
```

📜 A spreadsheet-like table and is the core data object that you will use.

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
l1 = list(
  x = c(9,4,5,2,6),
  y = c("male", "female", 
        "female", "male", 
        "female"),
  z = factor(y)
)
```

👝 It's much like a bag that you can put any object in (i.e., a flexible version of a `data.frame`).

]

Note: Data frames are a special list where all the elements are the same size.

---
# Importing Data

Almost any type of data can be imported into R with little effort.

--

We will show:

- CSV
- tab delimited
- space delimited
- SPSS 
- SAS export

--

Others are possible 😃

---
# Importing Data

.pull-left[
### Base R
**CSV**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- read.csv("File.csv")
```

**Tab Delimited**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- read.table("File.txt", 
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = "\t")
```

**Space Delimited**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- read.table("File.txt", 
                 header = TRUE,
                 sep = " ")
```

]

.pull-right[
### Others
**CSV**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readr)
df <- read_csv("File.csv")
```

**SPSS**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(haven)
df <- read_spss("File.sav")
```

**SAS**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(foreign)
df <- read.xport("File.xpt")
```

# R Objects

### Functions 💪

It's how we do stuff in R!

--

What are the pieces of a function (a named function)?

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
myfunction = function(arguments){
  stuff = that(the, function, does)
  stuff
}
```

1. a name
1. `function()`
1. arguments
1. stuff inside the `{}`
1. a return value (usually)

---
# Functions 💪

- How do you create your own function?

--
#### Write your own function that gives you the mean and range of each variable in a data frame.

--
#### Now update that function so it only takes the mean and range of numeric variables.

--
- One way:
```{r}
mean_range = function(df){
  means = lapply(df, mean)
  mins = lapply(df, min)
  maxs = lapply(df, max)
  final = data.frame("Mean" = unlist(means), 
                     "Range" = unlist(maxs) - unlist(mins))
  final
}
```

---
# Functions 💪
```{r}
mean_range = function(df){
  means = lapply(df, mean)
  mins = lapply(df, min)
  maxs = lapply(df, max)
  final = data.frame("Mean" = unlist(means), 
                     "Range" = unlist(maxs) - unlist(mins))
  final
}
```

- What does each piece do?

--
    - `lapply()`
--
    - `unlist()`
--
    - `final`
--
- What does `mean_range()` return?
--

#### What is something you'd like R to do for you? (let's create a function for it)

# Tidyverse 📦

A group of packages that make working with data intuitive and clean.

#### The steps of tidyverse:

1. import
1. tidy
1. transform
1. visualize
1. model
1. communicate

--

All these have the same overall goal: 

- **to produce "tidy" data.**

# Tidy Data

.pull-left[
Tidy data:

1. column is a variable
1. row is observation

The tidy form depends on many features of the data set.

E.g.

- For longitudinal data, this is generally the long form.

# Tidy Data

.pull-left[
We often need to reshape the data to get it into this form:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(furniture)
df_long = long(df,
               c("var1", "var2"),
               v.names = "var",
               idvar = "id")
```

`long()` takes a wide form to long form (which is many cases is the "tidy" form)

]

# Selecting, Filtering, Grouping, Summarizing

.pull-left[

**Base R**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Selecting
d[, c("var1", "var2")]

## Filtering
d[d$var1 == 1, ]

## Summarizing
lapply(d, mean)

## Summarizing by Groups
tapply(d$var1, d$group, mean)
```

]

.pull-right[

**Tidyverse**
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## Selecting
select(d, var1, var2)

## Filtering
filter(d, var1 == 1)

## Summarizing
map(d, mean)

## Summarizing by Groups
d %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarize(mean(var1))
```

# Join

# Join

From the tidyverse, you can easily do each type of join.

.pull-left[

```{r, eval=FALSE}
joined = d1 %>%
  inner_join(d2, by = "ID")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
joined = d1 %>%
  left_join(d2, by = "ID")
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
joined = d1 %>%
  full_join(d2, by = "ID")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
joined = d1 %>%
  right_join(d2, by = "ID")
```

]

Can do several in-a-row:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
joined = d1 %>%
  full_join(d2, by = "ID") %>%
  full_join(d3, by = "ID") %>%
  full_join(d4, by = "ID")
```

# Long and Wide

# Long

Using the wide data below:
```{r}
df_wide = data.frame(
  "ID" = 1:10,
  "X1" = rnorm(10),
  "X2" = rnorm(10),
  "Y1" = runif(10),
  "Y2" = runif(10)
)
```

We are going to reshape this to long format.

```{r, eval=require('furniture')}
library(furniture)
df_long = long(df_wide,
               c("X1", "X2"),
               c("Y1", "Y2"),
               v.names = c("X", "Y"))
```

---
# Long

```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
datatable(
  df_long %>% arrange(ID, time) %>% round(., 4),
  extensions = c('KeyTable', 'Responsive'),
  fillContainer = FALSE, 
  options = list(pageLength = 5,
                 dom = 'Bfrtip',
                 deferRender = TRUE,
                 keys = TRUE)
)
```

---
# Wide

Using the `df_long` we just created, let's reshape it back to wide.

```{r, eval=require('furniture')}
df_wide = wide(df_long,
               v.names = c("X", "Y"),
               timevar = "time")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datatable(
  df_wide %>% arrange(ID) %>% round(., 4),
  extensions = c('KeyTable', 'Responsive'),
  fillContainer = FALSE, 
  options = list(pageLength = 5,
                 dom = 'Bfrtip',
                 deferRender = TRUE,
                 keys = TRUE)
)
```

# End of Review of Data Manipulation

### Hopefully much of this was familiar.
### Next we will review tables and `ggplot2`
