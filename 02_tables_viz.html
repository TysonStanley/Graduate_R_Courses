# Data

For these slides, the activities, and examples we will use the "Office_Parks" data set. 

- Contains ficticious data on both *The Office (U.S.)* and *Parks and Recreation* television shows
- Longitudinal (two time points) and nested (within show)
- Currently in wide format

--

Data can be downloaded from: [tysonstanley.github.io](https://tysonstanley.github.io/assets/Data/OfficeParks.csv)

# Explore the Data

#### What are some ways to explore this data?

--

- data summaries via tables
- univariate and multi-variate plots

### Quick Summaries

.pull-left[
Among the important aspects of the data to explore include:

- correlations
- means and standard deviations
- ranges
- distributions
- missingness
]

--

.pull-right[
For this we'll use a few functions:

1. `furniture::tableC()`
1. `furniture::table1()`
1. `summary()`
1. `psych::describe()`
]

---
# Correlations


```r
library(furniture)

       prod1, ment1, depr1, awkw1,
       na.rm=TRUE)

Any surprises? 

--

- `awkw1` seems massively different
- Could be a problem with the data

--

We can see if there are weird things in the ranges and distributions

---
# Ranges and Distributions


```r
library(tidyverse)   ## for the pipe and select()
d %&gt;%
  select(awkw1, awkw2) %&gt;%
  psych::describeBy(group = d$show)
```


```
## Parks and Rec
```

```
##       vars  n   mean    sd median trimmed   mad min max range    
## awkw1    1 17 12.235 4.562     10  12.333 7.413   4  19    15 ...
## awkw2    2 22 14.909 7.030     13  14.889 9.637   4  26    22 ...
```

```
## ------
## The Office
```

```
##       vars  n  mean    sd median trimmed   mad min max range    
## awkw1    1 16 2.625 1.258      3   2.571 1.483   1   5     4 ...
## awkw2    2 16 1.938 1.769      2   1.786 2.224   0   6     6 ...
```

All descriptives suggest there is a problem with the `awkw1` measures between the shows.

# Univariate and Multi-variate Plots

We can only assess the data so much without plots. 

Generally, there are two things we want to understand quickly:

- distributions
- relationships
    - especially bi-variate or tri-variate relationships

--
### Some background on `ggplot2`

Three major aspects:

- **layers**: The layers include all the points, bars, lines, etc. The `geom_` functions. 
- **scales**: The scales the scales of the x and y, the colors, the fills, etc. The `scale_` functions.
- **facets**: The facets are the stratified plots. The `facet_` functions.

Additionally, the general look of the plot can be controlled by the `theme` functions.

---
# Univariate Plots
### Simplest

```r
qplot(d$awkw1)
```

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Univariate Plots
### Better

```r
ggplot(d, aes(x=awkw1)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, 
               fill = "dodgerblue4", 
               color = "dodgerblue4")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Univariate-ish Plots
### Even Better

```r
ggplot(d, aes(x=awkw1, group = show, fill = show, color = show)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5)
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Univariate-ish Plots
### Maybe Best?

```r
ggplot(d, aes(x=awkw1, group = show, fill = show, color = show)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5) +
  theme_classic()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_density).
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Some Notes, Comments, and Questions

--
- The warning: there are some missing values!
--

- Again, `awkw1` looks iffy.
--

- What else would you like to do to the plot?
--

- Would you want to try a different type of plot?

---
# Multi-variate Plots

Let's check some relationships using

- scatterplots

- scatterplots with groups

- joy plots

- bar plots

- line plots

We'll use the `group`, `color` and `fill` options as well as the `facet_` functions.

Let's get a blank plot started for each scatterplot and make `gend` a factor.

```r
d$gend = factor(d$gend, labels = c("Male", "Female"))
scatter &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(x = awkw1, y = prod1))
```

---
# Scatterplot

```r
scatter + geom_jitter()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

# Scatterplot

```r
scatter + geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).
```

```
## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

# Scatterplot with Interaction
Let's see if there appear to be differences across the genders. 


```r
scatter + 
  geom_jitter(aes(group = gend, color = gend)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = gend, color = gend),
              method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

# Joy Plots

To create a joy plot, we need to reshape our data a bit. We are going to do two steps of reshaping: 

1. Put our data in long form based on the time periods, and
1. Turn each variable into a single variable for the joy plot.

--

```r
df_long = long(d,
               c("prod1", "prod2"),
               c("ment1", "ment2"),
               c("depr1", "depr2"),
               c("awkw1", "awkw2"),
               v.names = c("Prod", "Ment", "Depr", "Awkw"),
               timevar = "Time") %&gt;%
  long(c("Prod", "Ment", "Depr", "Awkw"),
       v.names = "Value",
       timevar = "Variable",
       times = c("Prod", "Ment", "Depr", "Awkw"),
       id = c("id", "Time"))
```

# Joy Plots

```r
library(ggjoy)
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Value, y = Variable)) +
  geom_joy(alpha = .7)
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

This highlights the overall distributions but ignores time points.
---
# Joy Plots

```r
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Value, y = Variable)) +
  geom_joy(aes(fill = factor(Time),
               color = factor(Time)),
           alpha = .7)
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

This, however, ignores the differences by show.

---
# Joy Plots

```r
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Value, y = Variable)) +
  geom_joy(aes(fill = factor(Time),
               color = factor(Time)),
           alpha = .7) +
  facet_grid(~show, scales = "free")
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

What patterns do you see?

---
# Bar Plots

In general, to do bar plots, we want some summary statistics (e.g., means and standard errors).


```r
summed = df_long %&gt;%
  group_by(Time, Variable, show) %&gt;%
  summarize(mean1 = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE),
            se1   = sd(Value, na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(n()))
```

---
# Bar Plots


```r
ggplot(summed, aes(x = Variable, y = mean1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge",
           aes(fill = factor(Time),
               color = factor(Time)),
           alpha = .9) +
  facet_grid(~show, scales = "free")
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

This is probably a bit much... Let's try a line plot instead.

---
# Line Plots

We are going to look at two types

1. Pre-Post Plots
1. Spaghetti plots

---
# Pre-Post Plots


```r
ggplot(summed, aes(x = factor(Time), y = mean1,
                   group = factor(Variable), color = factor(Variable))) +
  geom_line(alpha = .9) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(~show, scales = "free")
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

--

Much better! We can see trends for each variable across both time points really easily.

---
# Spaghetti Plot
We may want to see individual trajectories. Spaghetti plots are made for this.


```r
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = factor(Time), y = Value,
                   group = interaction(Variable, nam), color = factor(Variable))) +
  geom_line(alpha = .7) +
  geom_point(alpha = .7) +
  facet_grid(Variable~show, scales = "free")
```

![](02_tables_viz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---
# Spaghetti Plot
I want to highlight a piece of the code before.


```r
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = factor(Time), y = Value,
                    group = interaction(Variable, nam) , color = factor(Variable))) +
  geom_line(alpha = .7) +
  geom_point(alpha = .7) +
  facet_grid(Variable~show, scales = "free")
```

Note the:

- `interaction(Variable, nam)`
- `Variable~show` in the `facet_grid()` function

--

`interaction()` let's us group by more than one variable. Why would we want to do that here?

`Variable~show` facets the plots by both variables where one is the rows (`Variable`) and one is the columns (`show`). We could have them both be the rows (`Variable+show~.`) or both be the columns (`~Variable+show`).

---
# Use it ðŸ’ª

### Using the "OfficeParks" data set:

- **Understand time trends**
- **Find out if `awkw2` has the same problem as `awkw1`**
- **Find a way to fix `awkw1` (and `awkw2` if necessary)**
- **Demonstrate where there is a strong bivariate relationship (using a plot)**
